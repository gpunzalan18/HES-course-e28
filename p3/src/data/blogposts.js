        post: "So this weekend, My friend and I went to this food truck on Temple St and it made me feel nostalgic. Filipino songs were playing while we were waiting for our orders. The customers were speaking in Tagalog. And the food‚Ä¶. ‚ô• Oh my! There‚Äôs isaw ng manok (chicken intestines), fish balls, kwek-kwek (quail eggs cooked in the orange breading you see above), betamax (grilled chicken blood), and MY FAVORITE isaw ng baboy (pig intestines; shown in the picture above). AHHH. It‚Äôs like my childhood all over again. :) Some people would probably say ‚ÄúYUCK‚Äù to these types of food.I mean, I guess it‚Äôs understandable.But if you ever get a chance, try them ? :) They are great protein sources! And most of them are REALLY REALLY REALLY delicious, especially if you pair them with the sweet sauce or the vinegar sauce that the vendors make. :D So yea.Filipino Pride. "

        post: "So when I first heard that LASO, a club at my school, was doing a skiing trip, I immediately signed up. I initially thought we‚Äôd go somewhere far from campus‚Ä¶ but we went to the Commons, which is just behind Farley. At first I was kinda sad cuz I really thought we were going off campus. But at the end of the trip, I was really glad I went.Putting on the skis could actually be complicated, especially when there‚Äôs ice stuck inside. If that ever happens, pour some hot water on it! Hah anyway, I fell a lot of times and even crashed into a tree. It‚Äôs okay though. It‚Äôs all part of the experience. :‚Äô)"

        post: "Back when I was in the Philippines, Halloween wasn‚Äôt something my family celebrated (I actually don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a thing in my country at all). But around the same time, we would visit my mom at the cemetery to celebrate her birthday and ‚ÄúAll Souls Day.‚Äù We would go there super early in the morning (before the sun rises) to find a good spot next to my mom‚Äôs because the place would get so crowded. We would set up a tent, settle all the food the we brought on a ‚Äúbanig‚Äù, and eat as one big happy family. :) my cousins would even bring a kite, cards, or badminton so we do something together. #missinghome That‚Äôs how I grew up spending that time of the year. But throughout my college experience, Bowdoin showed me that there are other ways to celebrate! Stay classy! ¬°Adios!"

        post: "The first time I heard about this place was in high school but I wasn‚Äôt interested then. I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt wanna pay an entrance fee to see a library. Haha But I take it back. :) So this trip was very educational! I learned a little bit about Henry Huntington, THE MAN‚Ä¶ THE FOUNDER of The Huntington. In his later years, He eventually married his uncle‚Äôs widow, Arabella Huntington, and together they transformed the place. They were fascinated by books, art, and gardens. So today, The Huntington has a library, where you can find the Gutenberg Bible, a European art gallery, and about 12 different botanical gardens, such as the Japanese Garden, the Desert Garden, and the Jungle Garden. My favorite part would probably be the bonsai trees. I could imagine their trunks as tiny bodies of dinosaurs! Ahhhh. So cool. I also really liked the Jungle Garden ‚Äòcause it made me feel like I was in the Hunger Games. Haha oh, and the Children‚Äôs Garden was very adorable, especially ‚Äòcause of the water fountains, and the kids running around. :‚Äô) The mausoleum, where both Henry and Arabella are buried, was also pretty cool. It was such a beautiful day! Plus, I got my exercise for the year. Haha I might have walked about 6 miles that day. :‚Äô)"

        post: "I have to say, I think SF is beautiful. The steep and narrow roads add character to the city. And the weather was perfect when we went there. So that‚Äôs a plus. :) Anyway, so this picture was taken at Lombard St, which is famous for its steep, one-block squiggly road filled with gorgeous looking flowers. So yea. If you find yourself driving around SF city one day, make sure to come by Lombard St. It‚Äôs amazing! <3"

        post: "The trees are amazing. The wind is refreshing. The rock formations are breathtaking. The waterfall is majestic. AHHHHH. Yosemite National Park is a jaw-dropper. ‚ô•  It was probably the highlight of my first road trip ever and I would love to go back so HMU? :D Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time at the park. I think we only stayed there for about three hours and we  spent half of the time taking pictures. haha If I were to go back soon, I would take my dad. One, because he‚Äôs my dad and he probably would cover the cost of the trip. So, no need for me to spend some dineros. :D Two, because I want him to take some time to relax and enjoy life. Plus, it could be a great bonding moment for both of us!"

        post: "So what can I say about this place‚Ä¶ The first time I went there, I bought myself a book‚ÄìThe Last Song by Nicholas Sparks. To be honest, I did enjoy reading the book. I remember staying up late at night on a school day just to read more pages. I have not seen the movie so I‚Äôm not sure how different it is from the book. But yea, I recommend the book. The best part about it though was that it made me look up videos of hatching turtles on YouTube. :) Lots of people go there to take pictures, film music videos, buy or read some books, listen to some educational talks, or just hangout. There‚Äôs also an art gallery. Oh and some of the sculptures around the store are amazing. In other words, the Last Bookstore is a really cool space. And it‚Äôs not that far! Just take the red line to Pershing Square and you‚Äôre almost there. haha"

        post: "The only thing I knew about Raging Waters was that‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a water park and it has water slides. I mean, I like slides and water so I figured, Why not? It can‚Äôt be that bad! And so on July 14, 2015, I went there along with eleven other cool Filipinos. ;) I would say that my first slide, Neptune‚Äôs Fury, made me a bit more courageous. Although I was nervous at first, it felt really nice. The water splashing on my face. Friends screaming. The unpredictable turns and sways of the purple tube in complete darkness.  Ahhhh. So good. :) Then we went to the the Bermuda Triangle. Then the High Extreme, which was an INTENSE workout because the walk to get up there took longer than the slide down. HMMM‚Ä¶ They should probably invest in an elevator. Then the Lily Pads, which I didn‚Äôt really like that much. It just made my arms and my upper body sore the next day. But no complaints. At least I‚Äôm getting muscles. :) Then the Ragin‚Äô Racer, where I lost. BADLY. Then the Wave Cove and then the Amazon Adventure, also known as the Lazy River‚Äìone of my faves too."

        post: "So it‚Äôs been a long time since I wrote but here is an adventure from Maine! My friends and I went to the state park during prospie weekend just ‚Äòcause one of us has access to a car. It was such a lovely day, not too cold, not too warm. We walked around a trail and took pictures. We looked for the geocache box, which had lots of random things in it including a pine cone, a business card, and a coin. We also spend some time admiring the water‚Ä¶ The trees. And the rocks! AHHHH. So much appreciation for nature‚Äôs beauty."

        post: "It was so cold and so windy that actually did not get to the lighthouse. Hehe üòÖ Plus, the drive back from Rockland to school was about an hour so we didn‚Äôt really have enough time. But I took lots of pictures and jumped from one rock to the next. Andddd, I was with my friends. That‚Äôs all that matters! On our walk, we saw couples and families. There was even a wedding at the park near it! I guess Breakwater Lighthouse is a place of love! üíï (so cheesy haha)"
